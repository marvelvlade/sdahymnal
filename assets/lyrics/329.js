Jesus, Thou hast promised,
That where two or three,
In Thy name have gathered, 
Thou wilt present be; 
And Thy word believing, 
Now in prayer we kneel; 
Jesus, come and bless us; 
Lord, Thyself reveal. 

Refrain:
Jesus, come and bless us,
While we linger here; 
Jesus, come and bless us, 
Be Thou ever near.

Jesus, Thou hast met us,
Oft in seasons past, 
But we need Thy presence,
With us till the last; 
Come, O blessed Savior, 
And Thy grace display;
Hear us and accept us;
Bless us while we pray.

Refrain:
Jesus, come and bless us,
While we linger here; 
Jesus, come and bless us, 
Be Thou ever near. 

3
Jesus, tune our voices,
To Thy songs of praise; 
Be in each petition,
That to Thee we raise; 
May our faith grow stronger,
And our hope more bright; 
May our love be purer, 
And our path more light.

Refrain:
Jesus, come and bless us,
While we linger here; 
Jesus, come and bless us, 
Be Thou ever near.
