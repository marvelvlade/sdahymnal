Jesus, keep me near the cross;
There a precious fountain,
Free to all, a healing stream,
Flows from Calvary's mountain.

Refrain
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever,
Till my raptured soul shall find,
Rest beyond the river.

2
Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the bright and morning star,
Sheds its beams around me.

Refrain
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever,
Till my raptured soul shall find,
Rest beyond the river.

3
Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadow o'er me.

Refrain
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever,
Till my raptured soul shall find,
Rest beyond the river.

4
Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.

Refrain
In the cross, in the cross,
Be my glory ever,
Till my raptured soul shall find,
Rest beyond the river.
