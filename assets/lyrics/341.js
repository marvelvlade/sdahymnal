The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?
By day and by night His presence is near;
He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;
This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.

Refrain:
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;
By day and by night He leads me along;
The lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night He leads me along.

2
The Lord is my light; though clouds may arise,
Faith, stronger that sight, looks up to the skies,
Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign:
Then how can I ever in darkness remain?

Refrain:
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;
By day and by night He leads me along;
The lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night He leads me along.

3
The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength;
I know in His might I'll conquer at length;
My weakness in mercy He covers with power,
And, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour.

Refrain:
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;
By day and by night He leads me along;
The lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night He leads me along.

4
The Lord is my light, my all and in all;
There is in His sight no darkness at all;
He is my Redeemer, my Savior and King;
With saints and with angels His praises I sing.

Refrain:
The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;
By day and by night He leads me along;
The lord is my light, my joy and my song;
By day and by night He leads me along.
