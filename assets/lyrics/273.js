Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.
And thus surround the throne.

Refrain:
We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion,
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

2
Let those refuse to sing who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly King,
But children of the heavenly King,
May speak their joys abroad, may speak their joys abroad.

Refrain:
We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion,
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

3
The hill of Zion yields a thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Or walk the golden streets. Or walk the golden streets.

Refrain:
We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion,
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

4
Then let our songs abound, and every tear be dry;
We're marching through Emmanuel's ground,
We're marching through Emmanuel's ground,
To fairer worlds on high, to fairer worlds on high.

Refrain:
We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion,
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.
