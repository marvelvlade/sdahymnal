Father, we come to Thee, no other help have we;  
Thou wilt our refuge be, on Thee we call, 
Earth is but dark and drear without Thy presence near;  
Be Thou our comfort here, Father of all. 

Refrain:
Father, we come to Thee, 
Turn not away; 
Helpless we come to Thee, 
Hear while we pray. 

2
Save from our many foes, save from our earthly woes;  
Be Thou our soul's repose in time of need.  
Doubting are we, and weak; to us sweet courage speak;  
Thy mighty arm we seek for strength indeed.

Refrain:
Father, we come to Thee, 
Turn not away; 
Helpless we come to Thee, 
Hear while we pray. 

3
Give us Thy grace divine, seal us forever Thine; 
Our wayward feet incline from sin to flee. 
Oh, guide us, we implore, till weary life is o'er, 
And on a brighter shore we dwell with Thee. 

Refrain:
Father, we come to Thee, 
Turn not away; 
Helpless we come to Thee, 
Hear while we pray.
