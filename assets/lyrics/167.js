Someone will enter the pearly gate,
By and by, by and by,
Taste of the glories that there await,
Shall you? Shall I? Shall you? Shall I?
Someone will travel the streets of gold,
Beautiful visions will there behold,
Feast on the pleasures so long foretold:
Shall you? Shall I? Shall you? Shall I?

2
Some one will gladly his cross lay down,
By and by, by and by,
Faithful, approved, shall receive a crown, 
Shall you? Shall I? Shall you? Shall I?
Some one the glorious King will see,
Ever from sorrow of earth be free,
Happy with Him thro' eternity: 
Shall you? Shall I? Shall you? Shall I?

3
Some one will knock when the door is shut,
By and by, by and by,
Hear a voice saying, "I know you not,"
Shall you? Shall I? Shall you? Shall I?
Someone will call and shall not be heard,
Vainly will strive when the door is barred,
Someone will fail of the saint's reward:
Shall you? Shall I? Shall you? Shall I?

4
Someone will sing the triumphant song,
By and by, by and by,
Join in the praise with the blood-bought throng,
Shall you? Shall I? Shall you? Shall I?
Someone will greet on the golden shore,
Loved ones of earth who have gone before,
Safe in the glory for evermore:
Shall you? Shall I? Shall you? Shall I?
