Hark! The herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new born King,
Peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, all ye nations rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With th'angelic host proclaim,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
Hark! The herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new born King!"

2
Christ, by highest heaven adored;
Christ, the everlasting Lord;
In the manger born a King,
While adoring angels sing.
"Peace on earth, to men good will;"
Bid the trembling soul be still,
Christ on earth has come to dwell,
Jesus, our Emmanuel!
Hark! The herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new born King!"

3
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
Life and Light to all He brings,
Risen with healing in His wings.
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
Hark! The herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new born King!"
