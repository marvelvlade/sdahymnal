What says the Bible, the blessed Bible?
This should my only question be;
Teachings of men so often mislead us,
What says the Book of God for me?

Refrain:
What says the Bible? Few can tell;
What says the Bible? Study it well.
Keep the commandments, the Ten Commandments,
Look for the coming Savior too.

Few ever study the Law Eternal,
Few ever seek to know or do;
Yet there are some who try to improve it,
Touching the fourth commandment too.

Refrain:
What says the Bible? Few can tell;
What says the Bible? Study it well.
Keep the commandments, the Ten Commandments,
Look for the coming Savior too.

How will you answer at Jesus' coming,
Ye who Jehovah's law construe?
Can you reply, "I've kept the commandments?",
Answer the question, each of you.

Refrain:
What says the Bible? Few can tell;
What says the Bible? Study it well.
Keep the commandments, the Ten Commandments,
Look for the coming Savior too.
