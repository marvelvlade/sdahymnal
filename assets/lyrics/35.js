O Love that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in thee;
I give thee back the life I owe,
That in thine ocean depths,
Its flow may richer, fuller be.

2
O Light that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to thee;
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in they sunshine's blaze,
Its day may brighter, fairer be.

3
O Joy that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to thee;
I trace the rainbow thru the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain,
That morn shall tearless be.

4
O Cross that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from thee;
I lay in dust life's glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms,
Red life that shall endless be.
