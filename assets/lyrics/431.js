Stand up, stand up for Jesus, ye soldiers of the cross;
Lift high His royal banner, it must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished, and Christ is Lord indeed.

2
Stand up, stand up for Jesus, the trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict, in this His glorious day.
Ye that are His now serve Him against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger, and strength to strength oppose.

3
Stand up, stand up for Jesus, stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you, ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the gospel armor, and, watching unto prayer;
Where duty calls, or danger, be never wanting there.

4
Stand up, stand up for Jesus, the strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle, the next the victor's song.
To him that overcometh, a crown of life shall be;
He with the King of Glory shall reign eternally.
