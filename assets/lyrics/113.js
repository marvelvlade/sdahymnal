When Jesus shall gather the nations, 
Before Him at last to appear, 
Then how shall we stand in the judgment, 
When summoned our sentence to hear? 

Refrain:
He will gather the wheat in His garner, 
But the chaff will He scatter away; 
Then how shall we stand in the judgment,
Of the great resurrection day? 

2
Shall we hear, from the lips of the Savior, 
The words "Faithful servant, well done," 
Or, trembling with fear and with anguish,
Be banished away from His throne?

Refrain:
He will gather the wheat in His garner, 
But the chaff will He scatter away; 
Then how shall we stand in the judgment,
Of the great resurrection day? 

3
He will smile when He looks on His children, 
And sees on the ransomed His seal;
He will clothe them in heavenly beauty, 
As low at His footstool they kneel.

Refrain:
He will gather the wheat in His garner, 
But the chaff will He scatter away; 
Then how shall we stand in the judgment,
Of the great resurrection day? 

4
Then let us be watching and waiting, 
With lamps burning steady and bright; 
When the Bridegroom shall call to the wedding,
O may we be ready for flight!

Refrain:
He will gather the wheat in His garner, 
But the chaff will He scatter away; 
Then how shall we stand in the judgment,
Of the great resurrection day? 

5
Thus living with hearts fixed on heaven, 
In patience we wait for the time,
When, the days of our pilgrimage ended, 
We'll bask in the presence divine.

Refrain:
He will gather the wheat in His garner, 
But the chaff will He scatter away; 
Then how shall we stand in the judgment,
Of the great resurrection day?
