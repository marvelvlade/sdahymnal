Jesus is all the world to me, my life, my joy, my all;
He is my strength from day to day without Him I would fall,
When I am sad, to Him I go, no other one can cheer me so,
When I am sad, He makes me glad, He's my friend.

2
Jesus is all the world to me, my Friend in trials sore;
I go to Him for blessings, and He gives them o'er and o'er,
He sends the sunshine and the rain, He sends the harvest's golden grain;
Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain, He's my friend.

3
Jesus is all the world to me, and true to Him I'll be;
O how could I this Friend deny, when He's so true to me?
Following Him I know I'm right, He watches o'er me day and night;
Following Him by day and night, He's my friend.

4		
Jesus is all the world to me, I want no better friend;
I trust Him now, I'll trust Him when life's fleeting days shall end.
Beautiful life with such a Friend, beautiful life that has no end;
Eternal life, eternal joy, He's my Friend.
