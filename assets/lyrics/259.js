O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness,
Most beautiful, most bright;
On thee, the high and lowly,
Who bend before the throne,
Sing, holy, holy, holy,
To the Eternal One.

2
Thou art a port protected,
From storms that round us rise,
A garden intersected,
With streams of Paradise;
Thou art a cooling fountain,
In life's dry, dreary sand;
From thee, like Pisgah's mountain,
We view our promised land.

3
A day of sweet reflection,
Thou art, a day of love;
A day to raise affection,
From earth to things above.
New graces ever gaining,
From this our day of rest,
We seek the rest remaining,
In mansions of the blest.
