How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ!

Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him,
When our journey is complete.

Hope of earth and joy of heaven;
Precious Name (precious Name),
O how sweet! (O how sweet, how sweet),
