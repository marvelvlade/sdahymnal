This is my Father's world,
And to my listening ears,
All nature sings, and round me rings,
The music of the spheres.
This is my Father's world:
I rest me in the thought,
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
His hand the wonders wrought.

2
This is my Father's world,
The birds their carols raise,
The morning light, the lily white,
Declare their Maker's praise.
This is my Father's world:
He shines in all that's fair;
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass;
He speaks to me everywhere.

This is my Father's world.
O let me ne'er forget,
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the ruler yet.
This is my Father's world:
Why should my heart be sad?
The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!
God reigns; let the earth be glad!
