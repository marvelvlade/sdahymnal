Like as a father pities his child,
So the Lord pities the sinner defiled;
Waiteth in kindness, pities our blindness,
Longeth to welcome, though often reviled.

2
Like as a father when we believe,
Merciful still, He will gladly receive;
Listens to hear us, blesses to cheer us,
Pities whenever His Spirit we grieve.

3
Like as a father, ever the same,
He hath created, and knoweth our frame;
Watcheth the straying, guardeth the praying,
Bids us to trust in His almighty Name.

4
Like as a father, constant is He,
God in compassion regardeth our plea;
In need He cometh, precious His promise:
Father in heaven forever to be.
