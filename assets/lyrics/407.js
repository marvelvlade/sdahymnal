Closer to Thee, my Father, draw me, 
I long for Thine embrace; 
Closer within Thine arms enfold me, 
I seek a resting place. 

Refrain:
Closer with the cords of love,  
Draw me to Thyself above; 
Closer draw me,  
To Thyself above. 

2
Closer to Thee, my Savior, draw me,
Nor let me leave Thee more; 
Fain would I feel Thine arms around me, 
And count my wanderings o'er. 

Refrain:
Closer with the cords of love,  
Draw me to Thyself above; 
Closer draw me,  
To Thyself above. 

3
Closer by Thy sweet Spirit draw me,
Till I am all like Thee; 
Quicken, refine, and wash, and cleanse me, 
Till I am pure and free. 

Refrain:
Closer with the cords of love,  
Draw me to Thyself above; 
Closer draw me,  
To Thyself above.
