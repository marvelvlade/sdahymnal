Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing;
Fill our hearts with joy and peace;
Let us each, Thy love possessing,
Triumph in redeeming grace.
O refresh us, O refresh us,
Travelling through this wilderness.

Thanks we give and adoration,
For Thy gospelâ€™s joyful sound.
May the fruits of Thy salvation,
In our hearts and lives abound;
Ever faithful, ever faithful,
To the truth may we be found.
