Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
Weep o'er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus, the Mighty to save.

Refrain:
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

2
Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

Refrain:
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

3
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
Back to the narrow way patiently win them;
Tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died.

Refrain:
Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
