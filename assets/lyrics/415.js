Watch, ye saints, with eyelids waking;
Lo! The powers of heaven are shaking;
Keep your lamps all trimmed and burning,
Ready for your Lord's returning.

Refrain:
Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes; Lo!
He comes, He comes all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious, Lo!
He comes, yes, Jesus comes!

2
Lo! The promise of your Savior,
Pardoned sin and purchased favor,
Blood-washed robes and crowns of glory;
Haste to tell redemption's story.

Refrain:
Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes; Lo!
He comes, He comes all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious, Lo!
He comes, yes, Jesus comes!

Kingdom at their base are crumbling,
Hark! His chariot wheels are rumbling;
Tell, O tell of grace abounding,
While the seventh trump is sounding.

Refrain:
Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes; Lo!
He comes, He comes all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious, Lo!
He comes, yes, Jesus comes!

4
Nations wane, though proud and stately;
Christ His kingdom hasteneth greatly;
Earth her latest pasts is summing;
Shout, ye saints, your Lord is coming.

Refrain:
Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes; Lo!
He comes, He comes all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious, Lo!
He comes, yes, Jesus comes!

5
Sinners, come, while Christ is pleading;
Now for you He's interceding;
Haste, ere grace and time diminished,
Shall proclaim the mystery finished.  

Refrain:
Lo! He comes, lo! Jesus comes; Lo!
He comes, He comes all glorious!
Jesus comes to reign victorious, Lo!
He comes, yes, Jesus comes!
