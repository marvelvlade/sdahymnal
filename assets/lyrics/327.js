’Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,
And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;
If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

Refrain:
Blessed hour of prayer,
Blessed hour of prayer,
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!

’Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,
With a tender compassion His children to hear;
When He tells us we may cast at His feet ev’ry care,
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

Refrain:
Blessed hour of prayer,
Blessed hour of prayer,
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!

3
’Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried,
To the Savior who loves them their sorrow confide;
With a sympathizing heart He removes ev’ry care;
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

Refrain:
Blessed hour of prayer,
Blessed hour of prayer,
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!

4
At the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him, we believe,
That the blessing we’re needing we’ll surely receive;
In the fullness of this trust we shall lose ev’ry care;
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!

Refrain:
Blessed hour of prayer,
Blessed hour of prayer,
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!
