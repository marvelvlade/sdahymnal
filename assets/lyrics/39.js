Of Jesus' love that sought me,
When I was lost in sin;
Of wondrous grace that brought me,
Back to His fold again;
Of heights and depths of mercy,
Far deeper than the sea,
And higher than the heavens,
My theme shall ever be.

Refrain
Sweeter as the years go by,
Sweeter as the years go by.
Richer fuller, deeper, Jesus' love is sweeter,
Sweeter as the years go by.

3
He trod in old Judea,
Life's pathway long ago;
The people thronged about Him,
His saving grace to know;
He healed the broken-hearted,
And caused the blind to see;
And still His great heart yearneth,
In love for even me.

Refrain
Sweeter as the years go by,
Sweeter as the years go by.
Richer fuller, deeper, Jesus' love is sweeter,
Sweeter as the years go by.

4
'Twas wondrous love which led Him,
For us to suffer loss,
To bear, without a murmur,
The anguish of the cross;
With saints redeemed in glory,
Let us our voices raise,
Till heav'n and earth reecho,
With our Redeemer's praise.

Refrain
Sweeter as the years go by,
Sweeter as the years go by.
Richer fuller, deeper, Jesus' love is sweeter,
Sweeter as the years go by.
