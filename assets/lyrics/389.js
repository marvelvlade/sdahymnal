Pass me not, O gentle Savior, 
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling, 
Do not pass me by.

Refrain:
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling, 
Do not pass me by.

2
Let me at Thy throne of mercy,
Find a sweet relief,
Kneeling there in deep contrition; 
Help my unbelief.

Refrain:
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling, 
Do not pass me by.

3
Trusting only in Thy merit, 
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit, 
Save me by Thy grace.

Refrain:
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling, 
Do not pass me by.

4
Thou the spring of all my comfort, 
More than life for me,
Whom have I on earth beside Thee? 
Whom in heaven but Thee?  

Refrain:
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling, 
Do not pass me by.
