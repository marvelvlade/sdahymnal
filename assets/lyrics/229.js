There's life in a look at the sacred cross,
Jesus has said, "Look unto me",
Earth with its riches is only cross,
Bright treasures beyond in the cross I see.

Refrain
In a look there's life for thee (in a look there's life for thee),
In a look at Calvary (in a look at Calvary),
Blessed thought, salvation free (blessed thought, salvation free),
By a look at Calvary (by a look at Calvary).

When first to the Savior I raised my eyes,
Sweet was the smile that fell on me;
Oft as the clouds of temptations rise,
A look at the cross still my strength shall be.

Refrain
In a look there's life for thee (in a look there's life for thee),
In a look at Calvary (in a look at Calvary),
Blessed thought, salvation free (blessed thought, salvation free),
By a look at Calvary (by a look at Calvary).

I'll look to the cross ev'ry day and hour,
Trusting the promise God has given;
None ever fall neath the tempter's pow'r,
Who trust and obey in the strength of Heav'n.

Refrain
In a look there's life for thee (in a look there's life for thee),
In a look at Calvary (in a look at Calvary),
Blessed thought, salvation free (blessed thought, salvation free),
By a look at Calvary (by a look at Calvary).
