Sound the battle cry, see! the foe is nigh;
Raise the standard high for the Lord;
Gird your armor on, stand firm, every one, 
Rest your cause upon His holy word.

Refrain:
Rouse, then soldiers! Rally round the banner!
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.

Strong to meet the foe, marching on we go,
While our cause we know must prevail;
Shield and banner bright, gleaming in the light,
Battling for the right, we ne'er can fail.

Refrain:
Rouse, then soldiers! Rally round the banner!
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.
 
3
O Thou God of all, hear us when we call,
Help us, one and all, by Thy grace;
When the battle's done, and the victory won,
May we wear the crown before Thy face.  

Refrain:
Rouse, then soldiers! Rally round the banner!
Ready, steady, pass the word along;
Onward, forward, shout aloud hosanna!
Christ is Captain of the mighty throng.
