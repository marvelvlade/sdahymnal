My Lord has garments so wondrous fine,
And myrrh their texture fills;
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine,
With joy my being thrills.

Refrain:
Out of the ivory palaces,
Into the world of woe,
Only His grace eternal love,
Made my Saviour go.

2
His life had also its sorrows sore,
For aloes had a part;
And when I think of the cross He bore,
My eyes with teardrops start.

Refrain:
Out of the ivory palaces,
Into the world of woe,
Only His grace eternal love,
Made my Saviour go.

3
His garments, too, were in cassia dipped,
With healing in a touch;
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,
He took me from each clutch.

Refrain:
Out of the ivory palaces,
Into the world of woe,
Only His grace eternal love,
Made my Saviour go.

4
In garments glorious He will come,
To open with the door;
And I shall enter my heav'nly home,
To dwell forever more.

Refrain:
Out of the ivory palaces,
Into the world of woe,
Only His grace eternal love,
Made my Saviour go.
