Welcome, delightful morn, 
Thou day of sacred rest! 
I hail thy kind return; 
Lord, make these moments blest;  
From the low plane of mortal toys,
I soar to reach immortal joys. 

2
Now may the King descend, 
And fill His throne with grace; 
Thy scepter, Lord, extend, 
While saints address Thy face;  
Let sinners feel Thy quickening word,  
And learn to know and fear the Lord. 

3
Descend, celestial Dove, 
With all Thy quickening powers; 
Disclose a Savior's love, 
And bless the sacred hours;
Then shall my soul new life obtain,  
Nor Sabbaths be enjoyed in vain.
