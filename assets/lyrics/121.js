Beautiful valley of Eden, 
Sweet is thy noontide calm; 
Over the hearts of the weary, 
Breathing thy waves of balm. 

Refrain:
Beautiful valley of Eden, 
Home of the pure and blest,  
How often amid the wild billows,
I dream of thy rest, sweet rest! 

2
Over the heart of the mourner,
Shineth the golden day, 
Wafting the songs of the angels,
Down from the far away.

Refrain:
Beautiful valley of Eden, 
Home of the pure and blest,  
How often amid the wild billows,
I dream of thy rest, sweet rest! 

3
There is the home of my Savior;  
There, with the blood-washed throng, 
Over the highlands of glory,
Rolleth the great new song.

Refrain:
Beautiful valley of Eden, 
Home of the pure and blest,  
How often amid the wild billows,
I dream of thy rest, sweet rest!
