Whosoever heareth, shout, shout the sound!
Spread the blessed tidings all the world around;
Tell the joyful news wherever man is found:
Whosoever will may come.

Refrain:
Whosoever will, whosoever will!
Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
'Tis a loving Father calls the wanderer home:
Whosoever will may come.

2
Whosoever cometh need not delay,
Now the door is open, enter while you may;
Jesus is the true, the only Living Way:
Whosoever will may come.

Refrain:
Whosoever will, whosoever will!
Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
'Tis a loving Father calls the wanderer home:
Whosoever will may come.

3
Whosoever will! The promise is secure;
Whosoever will, forever must endure;
Whosoever will! 'Tis life forevermore;
Whosoever will may come.

Refrain:
Whosoever will, whosoever will!
Send the proclamation over vale and hill;
'Tis a loving Father calls the wanderer home:
Whosoever will may come.
