Yield not to temptation,
For yielding is sin,
Each victory will help you,
Some other to win;
Fight manfully onward,
Dark passions subdue,
Look ever to Jesus,
He'll carry you through.

Refrain:
Ask the Savior to help you, 
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you; 
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.

Shun evil companions,
Bad language disdain,
God's Name hold in reverence,
Nor take it in vain;
Be thoughtful and earnest,
Kindhearted and true,
Look ever to Jesus,
He'll carry you through.

Refrain:
Ask the Savior to help you, 
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you; 
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.

3
To him that o'er cometh,
God giveth a crown,
Through faith we shall conquer,
Though often cast down;
He who is our Savior,
Our strength will renew,
Look ever to Jesus,
He'll carry you through.

Refrain:
Ask the Savior to help you, 
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you; 
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.
