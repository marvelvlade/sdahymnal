Another six days' work is done,  
Another Sabbath is begun; 
Return, my soul, enjoy thy rest,  
Improve the day that God has blessed. 

2
Come, bless the Lord, whose love as signs,
So sweet a rest to weary minds; 
A blessed antepast is given, 
On this day more than all the seven.

O that our thoughts and thanks may rise,
As grateful incense to the skies,  
And draw from Christ that sweet repose,
Which none but he who feels it knows.

4
This heavenly calm within the breast,
Is the best pledge of glorious rest,  
Which for the church of God remains, 
The end of cares, the end of pains.
