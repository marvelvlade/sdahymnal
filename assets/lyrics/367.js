Blessed Lord, how much I need Thee!
Weak and sinful, poor and blind;
Take my trembling hand and lead me,
Strength and sight in Thee I find.

Refrain:
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Blessed Lord, how much I need Thee!
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Savior, keep me ev'ry hour.

2
Clothe me with Thy robe of meekness,
Stained with sin this robe of mine;
Teach me first to feel my weakness,
Then to plead for strength divine.  

Refrain:
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Blessed Lord, how much I need Thee!
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Savior, keep me ev'ry hour.

3
Safe am I if Thou dost guide me;
Trusting self, how seen I fall!
Walk life's rugged way be side me,
Thou, my light, my life, my all.  

Refrain:
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Blessed Lord, how much I need Thee!
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Savior, keep me ev'ry hour.

4
Then what e'er the future bringeth,
Smiles of joy or tears of grief,
Still to Thee my spirit clingeth,
Thou art still my soul's relief.

Refrain:
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Blessed Lord, how much I need Thee!
Ev'ry hour, ev'ry hour,
Savior, keep me ev'ry hour.
