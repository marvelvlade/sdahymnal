The Name of Jesus is so sweet,
I love its music to repeat;
It makes my joys full and complete,
The precious Name of Jesus.

Refrain
Jesus! Oh, how sweet the Name,
Jesus! Every day the same;
Jesus! Let all saints proclaim
Its worthy praise forever.

I love the Name of Him whose heart,
Knows all my griefs and bears a part;
Who bids all anxious fears depart,
I love the Name of Jesus.

Refrain
Jesus! Oh, how sweet the Name,
Jesus! Every day the same;
Jesus! Let all saints proclaim
Its worthy praise forever.

That Name I fondly love to hear,
It never fails my heart to cheer,
Its music dries the falling tear;
Exalt the Name of Jesus.

Refrain
Jesus! Oh, how sweet the Name,
Jesus! Every day the same;
Jesus! Let all saints proclaim
Its worthy praise forever.

No word of man can ever tell,
How sweet the Name I love so well.
Oh, let its praises ever swell,
Oh, praise the Name of Jesus.

Refrain
Jesus! Oh, how sweet the Name,
Jesus! Every day the same;
Jesus! Let all saints proclaim
Its worthy praise forever.
