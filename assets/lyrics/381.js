Lord, I care not for riches, 
Neither silver nor gold; 
I would make sure of heaven, 
I would enter the fold; 
In the book of Thy kingdom, 
With its pages so fair, 
Tell me, Jesus, my Savior, 
Is my name written there? 

Refrain:
Is my name written there, 
On the page white and fair? 
In the book of Thy kingdom,  
Is my name written there? 

2
Lord, my sins they are many, 
Like the sands of the sea, 
But Thy blood, O my Savior, 
Is sufficient for me; 
For Thy promise is written,
In bright letters that glow, 
"Though your sins be as scarlet. 
I will make them like snow." 

Refrain:
Is my name written there, 
On the page white and fair? 
In the book of Thy kingdom,  
Is my name written there? 

3
Oh, that beautiful city, 
With its mansions of light, 
With its glorified beings,
In pure garments of white; 
Where no evil thine cometh,
To despoil what is fair, 
Where the angels are watching,
Is my name written there? 

Refrain:
Is my name written there, 
On the page white and fair? 
In the book of Thy kingdom,  
Is my name written there?
