I love to tell the story of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love.
I love to tell the story, because I know 'tis true;
It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do.

Refrain:
I love to tell the story, 
'Twill be my theme in glory,
To tell the old, old story,
Of Jesus and His love.

2
I love to tell the story; more wonderful it seems,
Than all the golden fancies of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story, it did so much for me;
And that is just the reason I tell it now to thee. 

Refrain:
I love to tell the story, 
'Twill be my theme in glory,
To tell the old, old story,
Of Jesus and His love.

3
I love to tell the story; 'tis pleasant to repeat,
What seems, each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story, for some have never heard,
The message of salvation from God's own holy Word. 

Refrain:
I love to tell the story, 
'Twill be my theme in glory,
To tell the old, old story,
Of Jesus and His love.

4
I love to tell the story, for those who know it best,
Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song,
'Twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long.

Refrain:
I love to tell the story, 
'Twill be my theme in glory,
To tell the old, old story,
Of Jesus and His love.
