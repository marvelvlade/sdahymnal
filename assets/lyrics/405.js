One thing I of the Lord desire, 
For all my paths have miry been, 
Be it by water or by fire, 
O make me clean, O make me clean. 

Refrain:
So wash me Thou, without, within, 
Or purge with fire, if that must be, 
No matter how, if only sin,
Die out in me, die out in me. 

2
If clearer vision Thou impart, 
Grateful and glad my soul shall be; 
But yet to have a purer heart, 
Is more to me, is more to me. 

Refrain:
So wash me Thou, without, within, 
Or purge with fire, if that must be, 
No matter how, if only sin,
Die out in me, die out in me. 

3
Yea, only as this heart is clean,
May larger vision yet be mine, 
For mirrored in Thy life are seen,
The things divine, the things divine.

Refrain:
So wash me Thou, without, within, 
Or purge with fire, if that must be, 
No matter how, if only sin,
Die out in me, die out in me. 

4
I watch to shun the miry way, 
And stanch the springs of guilty thought, 
But watch and struggle as I may, 
Pure I am not, pure I am not.

Refrain:
So wash me Thou, without, within, 
Or purge with fire, if that must be, 
No matter how, if only sin,
Die out in me, die out in me.
