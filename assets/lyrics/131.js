Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature,
O Thou of God and Man the Son,
Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor,
Thou, my soul's glory, joy, and crown.

Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands,
Robed in the blooming garb of spring:
Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer,
Who makes the woeful heart to sing.

3
Fair is the sunshine, fairer still the moonlight,
And all the twinkling starry host,
Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer,
Than all the angels heaven can boast.

4
Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations!
Son of God and Son of Man!
Glory and honor, praise, adoration,
Now and forevermore be Thine.
