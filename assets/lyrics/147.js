Break Thou the bread of life, dear Lord, to me,
As Thou didst break the loaves beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page I seek Thee, Lord;
My spirit pants for Thee, O living Word.

2
Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord, to me, to me,
As Thou didst bless the bread by Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease, All fetters fall;
And I shall find my peace, My all in all.

3
Thou art the bread of life, O Lord, to me;
Thy holy Word the truth that saveth me;
Give me to eat and live with Thee above;
Teach me to love Thy truth, for Thou art love.

4
Spirit and life are they, words Thou dost speak;
I hasten to obey, but I am weak;
Thou art my only help, Thou art my life;
Heeding Thy holy Word I win the strife.
