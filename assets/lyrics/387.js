Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! 
Thou art the Potter, I am the clay.
Mold me and make me after Thy will,
While I am waiting, yielded and still.

2
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me, Savior today!
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

3
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary, help me I pray!
Power, all power, surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine!

4
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way! 
Hold o'er my being absolute sway.
Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see,
Christ only, always, living in me!
