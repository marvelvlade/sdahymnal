If any little word of mine,
May make a dark life brighter,
If any little song of mine,
May make a sad heart lighter.

Refrain:
God help me speak the helping word,
And sweeten it with singing.
And drop it in some lonely vale, 
To set the echoes ringing.

If any little love of mine,
May make a hard life sweeter,
If any little care of mine,
May make a friend's the fleeter.

Refrain:
God help me speak the helping word,
And sweeten it with singing.
And drop it in some lonely vale, 
To set the echoes ringing.  

3
If any little lift of mine,
May ease a toiler bending,
God give me love, and care, and strength,
We live for Him by lending.  

Refrain:
God help me speak the helping word,
And sweeten it with singing.
And drop it in some lonely vale, 
To set the echoes ringing.
