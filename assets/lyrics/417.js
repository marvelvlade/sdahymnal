Sweet promises is given to all who believe,
"Behold I come quickly, Mine own to receive;
Hold fast till I come; the danger is great;
Sleep not as do others; be watchful, and wait."

Refrain:
"Hold fast till I come;" sweet promise of heaven,
"The kingdom restored, to you shall be given."
"Come, enter My joy, sit down on My throne;
Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come."

We'll "watch unto prayer" with lamps burning bright;
He comes to all others a "thief in the night."
We know He is near, but know not that day,
As spring shows that summer is not far away.

Refrain:
"Hold fast till I come;" sweet promise of heaven,
"The kingdom restored, to you shall be given."
"Come, enter My joy, sit down on My throne;
Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come."

Yes! This is our hope, 'tis built on His word,
The glorious appearing of Jesus, our Lord;
Of promises all, it stands as the sum:
"Behold I come quickly, hold fast till I come."  

Refrain:
"Hold fast till I come;" sweet promise of heaven,
"The kingdom restored, to you shall be given."
"Come, enter My joy, sit down on My throne;
Bright crowns are in waiting; hold fast till I come."
