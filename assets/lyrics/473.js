Not by man's own might nor power,
Will God's work on earth be done,
But by His Spirit, His mighty Spirit,
Will the blessed kingdom come.

Refrain:
Not by might nor by power,
Not by might nor by power,
But by His Spirit,
His Holy Spirit will the work be done.

But God needs you, O dear Christian,
And for you He calls today,
That by His Spirit, His mighty Spirit,
You may show the lost His way.

Refrain:
Not by might nor by power,
Not by might nor by power,
But by His Spirit,
His Holy Spirit will the work be done.
