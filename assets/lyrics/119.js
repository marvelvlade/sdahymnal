The coming King is at the door,
Who once the cross for sinners bore,
But now the righteous ones alone,
He comes to gather home.

Refrain:
At the door, at the door,
At the door, yes, even at the door;
He is coming, He is coming,
He is even at the door.

2 
The signs that show His coming near,
Are fast fulfilling year by year,
And soon we’ll hail the glorious dawn,
Of heaven’s eternal morn.

Refrain:
At the door, at the door,
At the door, yes, even at the door;
He is coming, He is coming,
He is even at the door.

3 
Look not on earth for strife to cease,
Look not below for joy and peace,
Until the Savior comes again,
To banish death and sin.

Refrain:
At the door, at the door,
At the door, yes, even at the door;
He is coming, He is coming,
He is even at the door.

4
Then in the glorious earth made new,
We’ll dwell the countless ages through;
This mortal shall immortal be,
And time, eternity.

Refrain:
At the door, at the door,
At the door, yes, even at the door;
He is coming, He is coming,
He is even at the door.
