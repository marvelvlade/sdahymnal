Redeemed! How I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child, and forever, I am.

Refrain:
Redeemed, (redeemed), redeemed, (redeemed),
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, (redeemed), redeemed, (redeemed),
His child, and forever, I am.

2
Redeemed! And so happy in Jesus!
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence,
With me doth continually dwell.

Refrain:
Redeemed, (redeemed), redeemed, (redeemed),
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, (redeemed), redeemed, (redeemed),
His child, and forever, I am.

I know there's a crown that is waiting,
In yonder bright mansion for me;
And soon, with the saints made perfect,
At home with the Lord I shall be.

Refrain:
Redeemed, (redeemed), redeemed, (redeemed),
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, (redeemed), redeemed, (redeemed),
His child, and forever, I am.
