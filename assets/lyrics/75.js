I've found a friend in Jesus, He's ev'rything to me;
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
The Lily of the Valley, in Him alone I see,
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.
In sorrow He's my confort, in trouble He's my stay,
He tell me ev'ry care on Him to roll.

Refrain:
He's the Lily of the Valley,
The Bright and Morning star;
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

2
He all my grief has taken and all my sorrows borne;
In temptation He's my strong and mighty tow'r;
I have all for Him forsaken, and all my idols torn,
From my heart, and now He keeps me by His pow'r,
Tho' all the world forsake me, and Satan tempts me sore,
Thro' Jesus I shall safely reach the goal.

Refrain:
He's the Lily of the Valley,
The Bright and Morning star;
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

3
He will never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith and do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,
With manna He my hungry soul doth fill.
Then sweeping up to glory, I'll see His blessed face.
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll.

Refrain:
He's the Lily of the Valley,
The Bright and Morning star;
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.
