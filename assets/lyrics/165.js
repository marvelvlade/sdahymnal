There is a gate that stands ajar, 
And through its portals gleaming, 
A radiance from the cross afar, 
The Savior's love revealing. 

Refrain:
O depth of mercy I can it be,
That gate was left ajar for me?  
For me, for me? 
Was left ajar for me? 

2
That gate ajar stands free for all,
Who seek through it salvation; 
The rich and poor, the great and small,
Of every tribe and nation. 

Refrain:
O depth of mercy I can it be,
That gate was left ajar for me?  
For me, for me? 
Was left ajar for me? 

3
Press onward, then, though foes may frown; 
While mercy's gate is open,
Accept the cross, and win the crown, 
Love's everlasting token. 

Refrain:
O depth of mercy I can it be,
That gate was left ajar for me?  
For me, for me? 
Was left ajar for me? 

4
Beyond the river's brink we'll lay,
The cross that here is given, 
And bear the crown of life away, 
And love Him more in heaven. 

Refrain:
O depth of mercy I can it be,
That gate was left ajar for me?  
For me, for me? 
Was left ajar for me?
