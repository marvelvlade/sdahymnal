The church has one foundation 'tis Jesus Christ her Lord;
She is His new creation by water and the Word.
From heaven He came and sought her to be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her, and for her life He died.

2
Elect from every nation, yet one o'er all the earth;
Her charter of salvation, one Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy Name she blesses, partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses, with every grace endued.

3
Though with a scornful wonder we see her sore oppressed,
Though foes would rend asunder, the Rock where she doth rest,
Yet saints their faith are keeping; their cry goes up, "How long?",
And soon the night of weeping shall be the morn of song.

4
'Mid toil and tribulation, and tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation of peace forevermore;
Till, with the vision glorious, her longing eyes are blest, 
And the great church victorious shall be the church at rest.
