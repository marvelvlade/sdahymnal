Jesus, the loving Shepherd, 
Calleth thee now to come,
Into the fold of safety, 
Where there is rest and room;  
Come in the strength of manhood.  
Come in the morn of youth, 
Enter the fold of safety, 
Enter the way of truth. 

Refrain:
Lovingly, tenderly calling is He:  
"Wanderer, wanderer, come unto Me";  
Patiently standing there, waiting. I see,
Jesus my Shepherd divine.

Jesus, the loving Shepherd, 
Gave His dear life for thee; 
Tenderly now He's calling, 
"Wanderer, come to Me"; 
Haste, for without is danger, 
Come, cries the Shepherd blest, 
Enter the fold of safety, 
Enter the place of rest. 

Refrain:
Lovingly, tenderly calling is He:  
"Wanderer, wanderer, come unto Me";  
Patiently standing there, waiting. I see,
Jesus my Shepherd divine.

Lingering is but folly; 
Wolves are abroad today, 
Seeking the sheep now straying, 
Seeking the lambs to slay; 
Jesus, the loving Shepherd, 
Calleth thee now to come,
Into the fold of safety, 
Where there is rest and room. 

Refrain:
Lovingly, tenderly calling is He:  
"Wanderer, wanderer, come unto Me";  
Patiently standing there, waiting. I see,
Jesus my Shepherd divine.
