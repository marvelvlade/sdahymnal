O Jesus, I have promised to serve Thee to the end;
Be Thou forever near me, my Master and my Friend.
I shall not fear the battle if Thou art by my side,
Nor wander from the pathway if Thou wilt be my Guide.

2
O let me feel Thee near me! The world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle, the tempting sounds I hear;
My foes are ever near me, around me and within;
But Jesus, draw Thou nearer, and shield my soul from sin.

3
O Jesus, Thou hast promised to all who follow Thee,
That where Thou art in glory there shall Thy servant be. 
And Jesus, I have promised to serve Thee to the end;
O give me grace to follow, my Master and my Friend.
