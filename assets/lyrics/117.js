O'er all the land have the signs now appeared, 
Telling us soon our dear Saviour will come; 
Long has the worn pilgrim watched, hoped, and feared, 
Waiting for that blessed hope; 0 come, Savior, come. 

Refrain:
Sound forth the tidings, long, loud, and clear;  
Jesus is coming, and soon will appear;  
All hearts respond as we long for our home, 
"Quickly come, 0 blessed Jesus, come, Saviour, come"

Signs in the sun and the moon and the stars,
Faithfully show that the great day is near; 
Nations distressed by the rumors of wars, 
And the hearts of wicked men are failing for fear.

Refrain:
Sound forth the tidings, long, loud, and clear;  
Jesus is coming, and soon will appear;  
All hearts respond as we long for our home, 
"Quickly come, 0 blessed Jesus, come, Saviour, come"

These, to the pilgrim, are omens of cheer, 
Toiling and sighing in life's gloomy way; 
All, all proclaim that the Savior is near, 
And the light is dawning of that soon-coming day.

Refrain:
Sound forth the tidings, long, loud, and clear;  
Jesus is coming, and soon will appear;  
All hearts respond as we long for our home, 
"Quickly come, 0 blessed Jesus, come, Saviour, come"

Then let us rally, and fresh courage take; 
Soon will we hear our dear Lord's loving voice; 
Those who will now all their errors forsake,
Soon the pearly gates will enter-sing and rejoice.

Refrain:
Sound forth the tidings, long, loud, and clear;  
Jesus is coming, and soon will appear;  
All hearts respond as we long for our home, 
"Quickly come, 0 blessed Jesus, come, Saviour, come"
