Angel voices sweetly singing, 
Echoes through the blue dome ringing,  
News of wondrous gladness bringing; 
Ah, 'tis heaven at last!

Refrain:
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
O, the joyful story of heaven at last! 
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
Endless, boundless glory, in heaven at last.

On the jasper threshold standing,
Like a pilgrim safely landing, 
See the strange bright scene expanding; 
Ah, 'tis heaven at last!

Refrain:
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
O, the joyful story of heaven at last! 
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
Endless, boundless glory, in heaven at last.

Softest voices, silver pealing,  
Freshest fragrance, spirit healing,  
Happy hymns around ns stealing; 
Ah, 'tis heaven at last!

Refrain:
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
O, the joyful story of heaven at last! 
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
Endless, boundless glory, in heaven at last. 

4
Not a teardrop ever falleth,  
Not a pleasure ever palleth, 
Song to song forever calleth; 
Ah, 'tis heaven at last!

Refrain:
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
O, the joyful story of heaven at last! 
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
Endless, boundless glory, in heaven at last. 

5
Christ Himself the living splendor,  
Christ the sunlight, mild and tender;  
Praise to the Lamb we render; 
Ah, 'tis heaven at last!

Refrain:
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
O, the joyful story of heaven at last! 
Heaven at last, heaven at last; 
Endless, boundless glory, in heaven at last.
