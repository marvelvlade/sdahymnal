Jesus is tenderly calling thee home,
Calling today, calling today; 
Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam,
Farther and farther away? 

Refrain:
Calling today, calling today;  
Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.

2
Jesus is calling the weary to rest,
Calling today, calling today; 
Bring Him thy burden, and thou shalt be blest; 
He will not turn thee away. 

Refrain:
Calling today, calling today;  
Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.

3
Jesus is waiting, Oh, come to Him now,
Waiting today. Waiting today; 
Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow; 
Come, and no longer delay. 

Refrain:
Calling today, calling today;  
Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.

4
Jesus is pleading, Oh, list to His voice,
Hear Him today, hear Him today;  
They who believe on His name shall rejoice; 
Quickly arise and away. 

Refrain:
Calling today, calling today;  
Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.
