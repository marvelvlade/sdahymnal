Must Jesus bear the cross alone,
And all the world go free?
No, there's a cross for everyone,
And there's a cross for me.

2
The consecrated cross I'll bear,
Till He shall set me free;
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there's a crown for me.

3
Upon the crystal pavement, down,
At Jesus' pierced feet,
With joy I'll cast my golden crown,
And His dear Name repeat.
