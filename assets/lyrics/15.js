1  
In joyful high and holy lays,
My soul her grateful voice would raise;  
But who can sing the worthy praise,
Of the wonderful love of Jesus?  

Refrain:
Wonderful love! Wonderful love!  
Wonderful love of Jesus!  
Wonderful love! Wonderful love!  
Wonderful love of Jesus!  

2  
A joy by day, a peace by night,  
In storms a calm, in darkness light,  
In pain a balm, in weakness might,  
Is the wonderful love of Jesus.

Refrain:
Wonderful love! Wonderful love!  
Wonderful love of Jesus!  
Wonderful love! Wonderful love!  
Wonderful love of Jesus!  

3  
My hope for pardon when I call,  
My trust for lifting when I fall;  
In life, in death, my all in all,  
Is the wonderful love of Jesus.

Refrain:
Wonderful love! Wonderful love!  
Wonderful love of Jesus!  
Wonderful love! Wonderful love!  
Wonderful love of Jesus!
