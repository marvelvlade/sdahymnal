I shall see the King,
Where the angels sing,
I shall see the King some day,
In the better land,
On the golden strand,
And with Him shall ever stay.

Refrain:
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
’Twas on Calvary,
Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King some day.

2
In the land of song,
In the glory-throng,
Where there never comes a night,
With my Lord once slain,
I shall ever reign,
In the glory land of light. 

Refrain:
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
’Twas on Calvary,
Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King some day.

3
I shall see the King,
All my tributes bring,
And shall look upon His face;
Then my song shall be,
How He ransomed me,
And has kept me by His grace.

Refrain:
In His glory, I shall see the King,
And forever endless praises sing;
’Twas on Calvary,
Jesus died for me;
I shall see the King some day.
