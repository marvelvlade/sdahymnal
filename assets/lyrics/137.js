There's no other name like Jesus,
'Tis the dearest Name we know,
'Tis the angel's joy in heaven,
'Tis the Christian's joy below.

Refrain
Sweet Name (sweet Name), dear Name (dear Name),
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet Name (sweet Name), dear Name (dear Name),
There's no other name like Jesus.

There's no other name like Jesus,
When the heart with grief is sad,
There's no other name like Jesus
When the heart is free and glad.

Refrain
Sweet Name (sweet Name), dear Name (dear Name),
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet Name (sweet Name), dear Name (dear Name),
There's no other name like Jesus.

'Tis the hope that I shall see Him,
When in glory He appears,
'Tis the hope to hear His welcome,
That my fainting spirit cheers.

Refrain
Sweet Name (sweet Name), dear Name (dear Name),
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet Name (sweet Name), dear Name (dear Name),
There's no other name like Jesus.

If He wills that I should labor,
In His vineyard day by day,
Then 'tis well if only Jesus,
Blesses all I do or say.

Refrain
Sweet Name (sweet Name), dear Name (dear Name),
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet Name (sweet Name), dear Name (dear Name),
There's no other name like Jesus.

If He wills that death's cold finger,
Touch my feeble, mortal clay,
Then 'tis well if only Jesus,
Is my dying trust and stay.

Refrain
Sweet Name (sweet Name), dear Name (dear Name),
There's no other name like Jesus;
Sweet Name (sweet Name), dear Name (dear Name),
There's no other name like Jesus.
