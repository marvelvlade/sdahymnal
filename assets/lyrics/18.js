How pleasant, how divinely fair,  
O Lord of hosts, Thy dwellings are! 
With long desire my spirit faints,  
To meet th’assemblies of Thy saints.  

2  
Blest are the souls that find a place,  
Within the temple of Thy grace;  
There they behold Thy gentle rays,  
And seek Thy face, and learn Thy praise.  

3  
Blest are the men whose hearts are set,  
To find the way to Zion’s gate.  
God is their strength; and through the road,  
They lean upon their helper, God.  

4  
Cheerful they walk, with growing strength,  
Till all shall meet in heaven at length;  
Till all before Thy face appear,  
And join in nobler worship there.
