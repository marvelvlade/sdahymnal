Would you win a Savior's blessing?
Freely, freely give;
Would you see His work progressing?
Freely, freely give;
Let your souls with love expand, 
Open wide a liberal hand;
Would you follow God's command?
Freely, freely give.

2
With a cheerful heart and willing,
Freely, freely give;
Like the dew its balm distilling,
Freely, freely give;
Have you little? Give your might;
O how precious in His sight!
He your offering will requite;
Freely, freely give,

3
Give to spread the grand old story, 
Freely, freely give;
Give to speed the light of glory,
Freely, freely give;
Would you gain a rich reward
In the harvest of the Lord,
Then obedient to His word,
Freely, freely give.
