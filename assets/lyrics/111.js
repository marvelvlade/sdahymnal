Called to the feast by the King are we,  
Sitting, perhaps, where His people he;  
How will it fare, friend, with thee and me,
When the King comes in? 

Refrain:
When the King comes in, brother, 
When the King comes in! 
How will it fare with thee and me,
When the King comes in? 

2
Crowns on the head where the thorns have been,  
Glorified He who once died for men;  
Splendid the vision before us then, 
When the King comes in.

Refrain:
When the King comes in, brother, 
When the King comes in! 
How will it fare with thee and me,
When the King comes in? 

3
Like lightning's flash will that instant show,
Things hidden long from both friend and foe; 
Just what we are will each neighbor know, 
When the King comes in.

Refrain:
When the King comes in, brother, 
When the King comes in! 
How will it fare with thee and me,
When the King comes in? 

4
Joyful His eye shall on each one rest,
Who is in white wedding garments dressed; 
Ah! well for us if we stand the test, 
When the King comes in.

Refrain:
When the King comes in, brother, 
When the King comes in! 
How will it fare with thee and me,
When the King comes in?
