'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
And to take Him at His word;
Just to rest upon His promise,
And to know, "Thus saith the Lord."

Refrain:
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er! 
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more!

2
O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
And in simple faith to plunge me,
Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

Refrain:
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er! 
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more!

3
Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking,
Life and rest, and joy and peace.

Refrain:
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er! 
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more!

4
I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end.

Refrain:
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er! 
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more!
