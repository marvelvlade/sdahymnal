Brightly beams our Father's mercy, 
From His lighthouse evermore, 
But to us He gives the keeping,
Of the lights along the shore. 

Refrain:
Let the lower lights be burning! 
Send a gleam across the wave! 
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman,
You may rescue, you may save.

Dark the night of sin has settled, 
Loud the angry billows roar; 
Eager eyes are watching, longing. 
For the lights along the shore. 

Refrain:
Let the lower lights be burning! 
Send a gleam across the wave! 
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman,
You may rescue, you may save.

Trim You feeble lamp, my brother:  
Some poor sailor, tempest tossed, 
Trying now to make the harbor, 
In the darkness may be lost. 

Refrain:
Let the lower lights be burning! 
Send a gleam across the wave! 
Some poor fainting, struggling seaman,
You may rescue, you may save.
