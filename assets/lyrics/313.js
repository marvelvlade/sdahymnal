I need Thee every hour, most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine can peace afford.

Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee; every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour; stay Thou nearby;
Temptations lose their power when Thou art nigh.

Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee; every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.

3
I need Thee every hour, in joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide, or life is vain.

Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee; every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.

4
I need Thee every hour; teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises in me fulfill.

Refrain:
I need Thee, O I need Thee; every hour I need Thee;
O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee.
