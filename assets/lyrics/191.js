I would be, dear Savior, wholly Thine;
Teach; Teach me how, teach me how;
I would do Thy will, O Lord, not mine;
Help me, help me now.

Refrain:
Wholly Thine, (O Lord) wholly Thine, (O Lord),
Wholly Thine, this is my vow;
Wholly Thine, (O Lord) wholly Thine, (O Lord),
Wholly Thine, O Lord, just now.

2
What is worldly pleasure, wealth, or fame,
Without Thee, without Thee?
I will leave them all for Thy dear Name,
This my wealth shall be.

Refrain:
Wholly Thine, (O Lord) wholly Thine, (O Lord),
Wholly Thine, this is my vow;
Wholly Thine, (O Lord) wholly Thine, (O Lord),
Wholly Thine, O Lord, just now.

3
As I cast earth's transient joys behind,
Come Thou near, come Thou near;
In Thy presence all in all I find.
'Tis my comfort here.

Refrain:
Wholly Thine, (O Lord) wholly Thine, (O Lord),
Wholly Thine, this is my vow;
Wholly Thine, (O Lord) wholly Thine, (O Lord),
Wholly Thine, O Lord, just now.
