My Father is rich in houses and lands;
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full - He has riches untold.

Refrain:
I'm a child of the King, a child of the King!
With Jesus, my Savior, I'm a child of the King!

2
My Father's own Son, the Savior of men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
But now He is pleading for sinners on high,
And will give me a home when He comes by and by.

Refrain:
I'm a child of the King, a child of the King!
With Jesus, my Savior, I'm a child of the King!

3
I once was an outcast, a stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth!
But I've been adopted, my name's written down,
An heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown.

Refrain:
I'm a child of the King, a child of the King!
With Jesus, my Savior, I'm a child of the King!

4
A tent or a cottage, O why should I care?
They're building a palace for me over there!
Though exiled from home, yet still I may sing:
"All glory to God, I'm a child of the King."

Refrain:
I'm a child of the King, a child of the King!
With Jesus, my Savior, I'm a child of the King!
