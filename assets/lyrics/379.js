The home where changes never come, 
Nor pain nor sorrow, toil nor care; 
Yes! 'Tis a bright and blessed home; 
Who would not fain he resting there? 

Refrain:
O wait! Meekly wait, and murmur not,  
O wait! Meekly wait, and murmur not;  
O wait! O wait! O wait! And murmur not. 

2
Yet when bowed down beneath the load,
By Heaven allowed, thine earthly lot; 
Thou yearnest to reach that blest abode, 
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not. 

Refrain:
O wait! Meekly wait, and murmur not,  
O wait! Meekly wait, and murmur not;  
O wait! O wait! O wait! And murmur not.

If in thy path some thorns are found, 
O, think who bore them on His brow; 
If grief thy sorrowing heart has found, 
It reached a holier than thou. 

Refrain:
O wait! Meekly wait, and murmur not,  
O wait! Meekly wait, and murmur not;  
O wait! O wait! O wait! And murmur not. 

4
Toil on, nor deem, though sore it be, 
One sigh unheard, one prayer forgot; 
The day of rest will dawn for thee! 
Wait, meekly wait, and murmur not. 

Refrain:
O wait! Meekly wait, and murmur not,  
O wait! Meekly wait, and murmur not;  
O wait! O wait! O wait! And murmur not.
