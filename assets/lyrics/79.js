There came from the skies in the days long ago,
The Lord with a message of love;
There world know Him not; He was treated with scorn,
This wonderful gift from above.

Refrain:
They crowned Him with thorns,
He was beaten with stripes,
He was smitten and nailed to the tree,
But the pain in His heart was the hardest to bear,
The heart that was broken for me.

2
There came to His own - to the dones that He loved;
The sheep that had wandered a stray;
They heard not His voice; but the friend of mankind,
Was hated and driven away.

Refrain:
They crowned Him with thorns,
He was beaten with stripes,
He was smitten and nailed to the tree,
But the pain in His heart was the hardest to bear,
The heart that was broken for me.

3
The birds have their nest, and the foxes have holes,
But He had no place for His head;
A pallet of stone on the cold mountain side,
Was all that He had for His bed.

Refrain:
They crowned Him with thorns,
He was beaten with stripes,
He was smitten and nailed to the tree,
But the pain in His heart was the hardest to bear,
The heart that was broken for me.

4
I cannot reject such a Savior as He;
Dishonor and wound Him again;
I'll go to His feet and repent of my sin,
Be willing to suffer the pain.

Last Refrain:
I'll take up my cross, I will walk by His side,
For the pathway of duty I see, (Yes, I see),
I will follow my Lord and abide in His heart,
The heart that was broken for me.
