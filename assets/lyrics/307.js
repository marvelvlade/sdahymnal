Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me,
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee;
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

2
Though like the wanderer, daylight all gone down,
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God, to Thee;
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

3
There let the way appear, steps up to heaven;
All that thou sendest me, in mercy given;
Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee;
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

4
Then, with my waking thoughts bright with thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise;
So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee;
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

5
Or if, on joyful wing cleaving the sky,
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I fly,
Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee;
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
